# Spring 2025 RSI Internship at ORNL - Workflow Systems Group ADIOS2 Project

## Overview
This repository contains all the materials and documentation for my Spring 2025 RSI Internship project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), focusing on optimizing data management in high-performance computing (HPC) environments using ADIOS2.

## Project Description
The project, titled "Optimizing Data Management in HPC with ADIOS2: A Comparative Study," investigates the performance of ADIOS2, a high-performance data management solution developed at ORNL. The study compares traditional I/O methods such as CSV with ADIOS2, highlighting the latter's superior performance in terms of speed, scalability, and efficiency.

## Key Findings
- **Performance Gains**: ADIOS2 significantly outperforms traditional methods, with read and write times drastically lower, demonstrating improvements of up to 95% in data processing speeds.
- **Scalability**: ADIOS2's modular design allows for enhanced scalability in demanding applications, making it suitable for large-scale scientific datasets and HPC applications.
- **Case Studies**: The application of ADIOS2 spans various fields such as climate modeling, nuclear reactor simulations, and large-scale machine learning workflows.

## Repository Contents
- **Presentation**: The PowerPoint presentation detailing the project scope, methodology, and results. (Link to presentation file)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive notebook demonstrating the data analysis performed, including code and visualizations. (To be added)
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the performance benchmarking of ADIOS2 versus traditional CSV methods.

## Future Directions
ADIOS2 is set to receive updates that will further enhance its capabilities in data compression, real-time processing, and user interface integration. This project underscores the ongoing need for advanced data management solutions in HPC and data-intensive applications.
